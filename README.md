# Pass
[WIP] An open-source electronic public transport ticket system made for Budapest.

## What's this about?
Budapest already tried to accomplish creating a system like MetroCard or Oyster several times with projects like Electra or RIGO, but they always failed. The main goal of this project is to create and demo something like the RIGO system.

## Are you serious?
Yes, totally. Also, it's our school project, so we are definietly going to work on this consistently so that we don't get a bad grade.

## How can I contribute?
There are (going to be) several cards under the `Projects` tab - feel free to assign some of them to yourself, or if you find a bug, please create an Issue for it, we'll look into it.
