![Pass banner with slogan](https://github.com/dandesz198/pass/blob/master/assets/Banner%20-%20with%20slogan.png?raw=true)

## What's this about?
Budapest already tried to accomplish creating a system like MetroCard or Oyster several times with projects like Electra or RIGO, but they failed every time. The main goal of this project is to create an open-source electronic ticket system that's suitable for cities.

## Are you serious?
Yes, totally. Also, it's our school project, so we are definietly going to work on this consistently so that we don't get a bad grade.

## Main goals
* *Phase 1* Develop a QR-code based electronic public transport ticket and pass system 
* *Phase 2* Add support for NFC cards
  * Possibly build a demo
* *Phase 3* Add support for prepaid-type accounts
* *Phase 4* Get a city to use this system

## While developing, try to keep an eye on
* Writing readable, reusable, clean, efficient and modern code
* Consistent, `camelCased` naming
* Avoiding code or feature duplication
* Avoiding dependency hell, use as few dependencies as possible
